# learn-opengl

My code when going through the [Learn OpenGL Tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/). I use CLion as my IDE along with its CMake integration.

Needed Debian/Ubuntu packages for development:
```
sudo apt install libglm-dev libstb-dev libglew-dev libopengl-dev
```

Needed macOS packages for development:
```
brew install glm stb glew
```
